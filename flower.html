<h1>what is flower</h1>
<p>A flower is the reproductive part of flowering plants, also known as angiosperms. It's often the most colorful and fragrant part of a plant and plays a crucial role in the plant's ability to produce seeds and fruit.</p>

<h1>Function</h1>
<p>The principal purpose of a flower is reproduction of the individual, leading to the survival of the species. Flowers not only produce spores, which become gametophytes that produce gametes (sex cells), leading to zygotes (fertilised cells), but also develop and help disseminate seeds. Sexual reproduction between plants results in evolutionary adaptation, which improves species survival. For this reason, plants favour cross-pollination. Facilitating this process is a key function of flowers and is often reflected in their form and structure. Specific structures to attract pollinators (animals that transport pollen), for example, are the most common adaptations</p>
<h1>Structure</h1>
<p>The structure of a flower, termed its morphology, can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part, consisting of non-reproductive structures such as petals; and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical, or complete,flower is made up of four kinds of structures arranged in sets (whorls) around the tip of a short stalk or axis, called a receptacle.The four main whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium</p>
